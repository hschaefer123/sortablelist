# SortableList

## [OpenUI5 Developer Blog](http://openui5.blogspot.com/2017/05/sortablelist.html)

> [UI5](http://openui5.org/) demo showing a sortable list with drag&drop handling.

### [Online Demo (SAP HCP)](https://sortablelist-p1940953245trial.dispatcher.hanatrial.ondemand.com/index.html)

The demo is a UI5 wrapper for the ScrollReveal project
[SortableList Git Repository](https://github.com/jlmakes/sortablelist)

The code uses most up-to-date browser features and is highly experimental (not thought to be used for productive apps).
It should only demonstrate some browser features and be a nice giveaway for XMas.

### Highlights

> - demo how to use [jquery-ui-sortable](http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/) with div elements on top of sap.m.List
> - adding touch support using [touch-punch](http://touchpunch.furf.com/) 
> - adding nice css shadow and transparency effect while dragging
